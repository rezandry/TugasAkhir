This module is a Python implementation of the watershed
algorithm for image segmentation.  The goal of this module
is not to compete with the popular OpenCV implementation of
the watershed algorithm.  On the other hand, the goal here
is to provide an alternative framework that is more amenable
to experimentation with the logic of watershed segmentation.

The best way to become familiar with this module is to spend
some time with the scripts in the Examples directory.  In 
particular, the following script

    WatershedSegmentationWith_no_Marks.py

provides a watershed segmentation with NO user-supplied markings
on the image.  And the script

    WatershedSegmentationWithMarks.py

first elicits from the user a set of marks on the image to
delineate the regions where the image gradients can be
modified and then carries out a watershed segmentation of
the image.
